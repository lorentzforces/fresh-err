# fresh-err

Errors getting fresh.

This is a pretty stupid package to give you a wide range of potential preambles to a user-facing error message.

For example: `ERROR: incorrect value provided` is WAY less fun than `*ambulance noises*: you bricked the datacenter`

A random message every time keeps the fun fresh!
